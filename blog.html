        <h4>HTML Broad</h4>
        
        <p> We began with HTML, a pretty important thing that these <br> next generations of kids should know. HTML is basically
        <br> how  the servers and computers communicate with each
        <br> other to fetch the information of a website. HTML is <br> the bones and organs of such website, and CSS is the <br> outside look. Well We learned how to code with
        <br> different headings, paragraphs, titles, how to add <br>bullet points and a list. These all have there seperate <br>coding and way the computers recognizes it and it was 
        </p>

<h4 id= "SHTML"> HTML Specifics </h4>
        <p> Now, lets go deeper into CSS. I learned many things, as <br> I said before, but the codes are the thing that 
        <br> confuse me sometimes, as they are sometimes just  
        <br> weird. But I also learned things about how to organize <br> things easier in CSS. Lets say I Want to target a 
        <br> specific paragraph, I would put inside the < p > code <br> a <Strong> Class= "Paragraph" </strong>. 
        <br> Then in CSS I would put #Paragraph {Code}. This making <br> it know that I want to chang something about that 
        <br> specific paragraph.

        <h2 id= "CSS"> CSS</h2>
        <h4> CSS Broad</h4>
        <p> Throughout my computers class I learned many things <br> about coding a website, but I really liked the CSS <br> portion. CSS is the way that a websites looks unique <br> and stylish. Its normally a section <strong> called  </strong> Stlye, 
        <br> so if it wasn't about that, it would  be pretty weird. <br> Well in CSS I learned about how to change the color of <br> text, how to rearrange all the text and how to 
        <br> basically make my website the most stylish possible.
        
        <h4 id= "SCSS"> CSS Specifics </h4> 
        <p> To be more specific on what I learned about of CSS, <br> I learned the codes you need. For example, if you <br> wanna choose the heading above this paragraph, <br> you'd put:
           <br> <strong> h4 {Sample text: Sample text;}. </strong> <br> 
        If you wanted to change the color of such heading, <br> you would put:
         <br> <strong> h4 {color: blue;} </strong> <br> 
         I also learned how to change the alignment of the <br> text and pictures, this being with the code of
         <br> <strong> h4 {text-align: center, right, or left} </strong> <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
