  <h2> HISTORY OF ALASKA </h2>

 <p class= "what-a"> Alaska is a U.S. State in the western part of Canada. It is mostly known for the beautiful sceneries it has, with mountains, forests, and glaciers. Alaska is also normally seen as a place to rest, with the dog breed of Siberiam Husky being the most recognizable. Alaska was originally from Russia, as they discovered it, Alaska meaning the Great Land. This was until the U.S. bought Alaska from Russia, becoming known as the biggest state of the U.S. </p>

The Denali Mountain's original name was Bolshaya Gora, meaning Denali in Russian, but it was changed in 1880 till 1896 into Densmore's Mountain. In 1896 it was changed to Mount McKinley to support William McKinley, who was aa presidential Candidate at that time. The name finally got back to Denali in 2015, when president Barrack Obama announced it was getting its original name back. The Denali Mountain is actually the center piece of the Denali National Park and Reserve, another great reason to visit Alaska. </p>
